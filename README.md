# CWJ Blog

This repository is for the my coding blog. Feel free to create your own!

## Description

This repository is the host of my coding blog. I'd like to share my experience in my journey of growing as a developer. Whether you are a Sr. or Jr. developer, I believe it is crucial to document your learning process. That is what this project is for. I want to share what I learn to others on my own ad-free site, rather than posting articles to Medium or somewhere else with an ad wall.
